This is a movie website to get the movie name, description and rating according to IMbd. This is where I have gotten the API for search and getting back the movie grid. 

I have used the bootstrap components Navbar, carousel and Movie Grid. These are modified using CSS to fit the page. 

This is hosted on Netlify, url is https://mytvsite.netlify.app 

I have included the accesibility report in documents, and as part of the submission, as shown in the recorded session from the lectures. 

I have addressed the comments on my original fail 
1. Hard coded pages now use an API to surface the movie information
2. A search bar has been added using an API, as suggested in the notes
3. Footer has been added, this inscludes a revert to home page, a search bar and a 'contact' us form.
4. The accessibility report has been updated to include the performace and other options via lighthouse. I have followed the demo on the recoded session for this.
